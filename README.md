# Web application for Hyperledger Fabric decentralized application 

Starter application built with [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) to connect to 
[REST API servers](https://github.com/shiqinfeng1/fabric-starter-rest) and transact on 
[Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) blockchain network
created with [Fabric Starter](https://github.com/shiqinfeng1/fabric-starter).

## Install and build

Install prerequisites: Node.js. This example is for Ubuntu 18:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Install Aurelia CLI
```bash
npm install aurelia-cli -g
```

Build
```bash
npm install && au build
```
## Create and start the network

Follow instructions on  [Fabric Starter](https://github.com/shiqinfeng1/fabric-starter) to create a network of member 
organizations who will run their REST API servers which will serve this web app.

- org1 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- org2 [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Serve by the API servers

Build to be served by [fabric-starter-rest](https://github.com/shiqinfeng1/fabric-starter-rest), 
assume it's cloned into `../fabric-starter-rest`.
```bash
au build --env stage \
&& cp index.html ../fabric-starter/webapp/ \
&& cp -r scripts ../fabric-starter/webapp/ \
&& mkdir -p ../fabric-starter/webapp/src && cp -r src/locales ../fabric-starter/webapp/src
```

## Development

Run in development
```bash
au run --watch
```
Your web application served by `au run` in development at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) will connect
to the API server of org *a* [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
